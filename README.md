About me
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I am passionate about software development. Every project is an opportunity for me to grow, and I approach it with curiosity, a spirit of continuous improvement, and a collaborative mindset.

Working across front-end, back-end, and cloud technologies, I strive to build reliable and secure systems that are focused on real user needs.

I believe that listening to user stories, working in synergy with the team, and optimizing every detail are key to creating high-performing, sustainable solutions over time.
